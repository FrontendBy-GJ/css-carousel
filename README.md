# CSS Carousel (No JS!)

A responsive, modern Digimon-themed image carousel built with HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript for dynamic slide generation.
The carousel uses advanced CSS features like scroll snapping, scroll markers, and scroll buttons for a smooth, interactive experienceâ€”no external JS libraries required!

## Features

- **Dynamic Slides:** Slides are generated from a JavaScript array, each with unique colors and images.
- **CSS Scroll Snap:** Smooth horizontal scrolling with snap-to-slide behavior.
- **Scroll Markers & Buttons:** Native scroll markers and navigation buttons (where supported).

</video>

## Browser Support
